# RDF_Query
Querying RDF triples extracted from natural language

Here is the Eclipse Project.

Description:
A semantic search engine framework written in Java which allows querying from a database of triples in RDF format (Resource Description Framework) and returns the best result using the semantic meaning of the words in the query, not the words themself. That has been possible through the use of a semantic dictionary, and specific algorithms of comparison on all the terms involved.
This is an example of a ipotetic request:
Query: ‘How many people live in New York?’ ->  Answer: ‘New York has 8,491,079 inhabitants’.
